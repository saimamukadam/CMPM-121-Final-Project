# Devlog Entry - 11/15/24

# Introducing the Team
1. Tools Lead - Krithik Dhandapani
2. Engine Lead - Myles Anderrson
3. Design Lead - Saima Mukadam

# Tools and Materials
1. We will use the Phaser framework for our game. We chose Phaser because we each have some experience using it in the past.
2. We will use Javascript as Phaser requires us to code in Javascript..
3. We will use tools such as VS Code and GitHub for our project. For our assets we may use Aseprite or other asset creation tools. We made these choices as we have experience using these tools for various projects.
4. Our alternate platform choice is Unity which is quite different from Phaser as it uses C# but our choice may change in the future.

# Outlook
We are hoping to accomplish creating a game with good visuals and mechanics. We anticipate the hardest part of the project will be trying to make a finished and polished game within the timeframe, but we will strive to meet our goals and achieve our vision. We are hoping to learn more about developing a game in a team and gain more experience in Phaser.
